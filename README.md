[![Go](https://github.com/middlewaregruppen/tcli/actions/workflows/go.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/middlewaregruppen/tcli/actions/workflows/go.yaml)

`tcli` is a command line utility for managing VMWare Tanzu namespaces and clusters

**Work in progress** *tcli is still under active development and most features are still in an idÃ©a phase. Please check in from time to time to follow the progress* ðŸ§¡

## Installing
Download pre-built binaries from [Releases](https://github.com/middlewaregruppen/tcli/releases)

## Using
The first thing you'll want to do is probably logging in. The `login` command will authenticate the user using their SSO credentials. 
```bash
tcli login -s https://supervisor.local -u beyonce -p 'MyP5ssW0rD'
```

Too many flags? You can use environment variables prefixed with `TCLI_` so you don't have to provide them each time. For example
```bash
export TCLI_SERVER=https://supervisor.local
export TCLI_USERNAME=beyonce
export TCLI_PASSWORD="MyP5ssW0rD"
```

Other useful things you can do
```bash
# Listing namespaces 
$ tcli list namespaces
beyonces-ns
cardis-ns

# Listing clusters
$ tcli list clusters -n beyonces-ns
NAME          CONTROL PLANE   WORKER   TKR NAME                           AGE     READY   TKR COMPATIBLE   UPDATES AVAILABLE
beyonce-test   1               2        v1.22.9---vmware.1-tkg.1.cc71bc8   21d     True    True             [1.23.8+vmware.3-tkg.1]
beyonce-prod   1               2        v1.21.6---vmware.1-tkg.1.b3d708a   15d     True    True             [1.22.9+vmware.1-tkg.1.cc71bc8]

# Logging in to a cluster will add a new context to your kubectl config file (kubeconfig)
$ tcli login beyonce-prod -n beyonces-ns
$ kubectl get pods -A
```

*The architecture of Tanzu does not allow you to use the same credentials for the supervisor cluster and guest clusters. So we have to log in to each cluster separately*
